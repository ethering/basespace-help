The Workgroup feature groups BaseSpace Sequence Hub users and gives them access to pooled resources. A workgroup consists of users who share data, storage, and other resources. 

Each workgroup has 1 designated administrator who can modify workgroup settings and add or remove users.

{% callout note, NOTE %} The workgroup administrator cannot be changed or transferred. {% endcallout %}

With a Professional subscription, an Illumina representative sets up the workgroup and designates 1 workgroup administrator.

With an Enterprise subscription, an Illumina representative creates a domain and designates a domain administrator. Domain administrators can create multiple workgroups and assign 1 administrator to each workgroup. 

The domain administrator can access and administer any workgroups in the domain. <!---See [Domain Administration](/articles/descriptive/domain-administration) for more information.--->

{% callout note, NOTE %}Users in your workgroup may incur costs related to data storage, compute, and analysis. To share project and run data only, use the [Get Link](/articles/tutorials/share-data-using-get-link) or [Share](/articles/tutorials/share-data-using-email) options.{% end callout %}
